# HW-wk855-week05
this week I tried ASCLLloader, also tried write script to make camera follows player(clone).
1. The idea I came up with was to turn dairy into game level. So I chose a dairy from a friend who experiencing anxiety and depressure, changed the words about "hurt","sad","cry" into code, and transform into game level. In future, I want to try to change dairy into landscape and make it into exploration game.
2. since there is no player in scene, so i tried to write a script make camera follow the spawn player. It failed and i am still looking for a solution. Through the camera i can't see anything but background. It seems not the problem about confusing player with play(clone), but lost the transform position data. Still trying...
